# Linux-Scripts

Good days for the developers are here. This repository will help them to setup prerequisites environments or installations in just a single command.

Like setting up Docker is time consuming and sometimes you might get stuck installing multiple versions of it.

I know you don't want to waste your time in setting up all the pre-configurations that are needed when you do will you setup a new OS or VM. This scripts can also be used for the production environments.


## Getting Started

Just clone the repository or download the required script and execute it like:

```
> sudo sh script.sh
```

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to run thses scipts because those things will be handled by themselves. 
But obviously, the INTERNET ;)

### Notes
 
1. All the Rancher Docker scripts are designed according to the Rancher's requirement for Docker. But, you can also use them for simple docker setup.
2. DM for any changes or request for new script.
